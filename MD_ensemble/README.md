- **MD_traj**: contains a models of the extended and closed HOIP RBR domain. The simulation trajectory file for the extended model can be found in the Zenodo [repository](https://zenodo.org/record/6583368).
- **scattering_profiles**: contains theoretical scattering profiles for exended HOIP RBR domain, complete MD trajectory, and MD trajectory sampled conformations that are below and above 30 angstroms. 
- **MD_collective_variables**: contains radius of gyration values (rgyr.txt), RING1-IBR (d1.txt) and IBR-RING2 (d2.txt) interdomain distances computed for MD trajectory frames.
- **MD_clusters**: cluster labels (.npy) for the MD trajectory, summary of cluster abundance percentages (.txt), extracted representative cluster members (.zip) and PyMOL script to load and visualize selected MD ensemble members.
