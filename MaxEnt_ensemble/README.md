- **0X_***: a number of consecutive scripts to setup, run and analyse BioEn optimisation to generate MaxEnt ensemble. 
- **output.files** contains optimized BioEn weights, scaterring profiles and $\chi^2$/$\theta$/$S_{KL}$ values. In addition, there is a folder _significant\_states_ containg data for significant MaxEnt states. The folder stores cluster labels (.npy) for significant states, summary of states abundance percentages (.txt), extracted representative cluster members (.zip) and PyMOL script to load and visualize selected MaxEnt ensemble members.
